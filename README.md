# RET-Model
This model, developed in MATLAB, predicts the performance of the solar power system at the Palmer Events Center in Austin, Texas. Phase 1 of the project did not consider a cloud or heat transfer model. Phase 2 implements these models, plus an economic analysis for a possible expansion of the site.
